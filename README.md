# Eat Da Burger!

### Summary

Want a burger? Create it! Life is your oyster and you can create any burger you can imagine! Want to eat it? You can do that too!! Well... symbolically anyway. But don't worry, gone is not forgotten. Every burger you (or anyone else) makes is saved forever, whether eaten or not. Unfortunately, once a burger has been eat by anyone, nobody else will be able to eat it. Of course you could always make another one!

### About the App

The reason for making this app was to try my hand at implementing my own ORM for mySQL, as well as try out Handlebars for rendering my html pages. The server is run via express in JavaScript, uses Bootstrap for styling, and  just a dash of jQuery.
